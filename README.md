# UW-API-Racket

This is a collection of all the Racket programs I've written during my first year

Most of them are not part of any assignments, so feel free to use them

I had a lot of fun writing these codes. I hope you find them useful



See comments in racket.rkt for available functions & usage


How to run from Windows:

1. download Dr.Racket from http://download.racket-lang.org/
2. open up the file "racket.rkt"
3. click "Run" in Dr.Racket (could take a while, it's loading all the files here)
4. simply close Dr.Racket to terminate


How to run from Linux:

1. cd $directory
2. >racket
3. >(enter! "racket.rkt")`
4. Ctrl+D to send EOF and terminate
